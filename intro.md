# Fake News: Analysis and Detection

ðŸš© Fake News Analysis-Detection ðŸš©

The main objectives of this project are to analyse what characterises fake news compared to non-fake news, as well as to develop a system capable of detecting fake news accurately.

ðŸ”¸ For the analysis of fake and not fake news, word clouds based on frequencies, odds ratio and TF-IDF are used. 

ðŸ”¸ For the detection of fake news we focus on the TF-IDF extraction technique as well as on the Naive Bayes family of models, which have proven to work well in the text classification task.
